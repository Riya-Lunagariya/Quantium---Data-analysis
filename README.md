# Quantium---Data-analysis
OVERVIEW OF THE TASK:

Analysis of Purchase Behavior
Objective: Understand customer purchasing patterns, focusing on chips purchasing behavior.
Actions:
Segment the data based on product categories to isolate chips purchases.
Analyze purchase frequencies, preferred brands, and pack sizes among different customer segments.
Identify key trends such as popular times for purchases and variations in spending across customer lifecycles.
Customer Segmentation
Objective: Segment customers to tailor marketing and product strategies effectively.
Actions:
Use demographic data (e.g., age, lifestyle) and purchasing data (e.g., average spend, product preferences) to create distinct customer segments.
Analyze the characteristics and purchasing behavior of each segment.
Selection of Trial Stores
Objective: Choose specific stores for conducting trials aimed at assessing the impact of strategic changes.
Actions:
Identify trial stores based on criteria like location, store size, and baseline sales performance.
Ensure a diverse representation of stores to generalize findings across the network.
Pre-Trial Performance Evaluation
Objective: Establish a performance baseline for trial stores and select control stores for comparison.
Actions:
Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, number of customers, and average transaction value for the pre-trial period.
Select control stores with similar pre-trial KPIs to each trial store for a fair comparison.
Conducting A/B Testing on Trial vs. Control Stores
Objective: Evaluate the impact of trials by comparing trial stores' performance against matched control stores during the trial period.
Actions:
Implement A/B testing for the trial period, analyzing changes in sales, customer count, and transaction patterns.
Use statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to assess the significance of observed differences.
Post-Trial Analysis and Recommendations
Objective: Assess the trial outcomes and provide actionable insights and recommendations.
Actions:
Compare trial stores' performance during and post-trial to control stores to identify sustained impacts.
Draw conclusions on the effectiveness of the trial interventions.
Recommend whether the changes should be adopted across other stores based on the trial outcomes.
Reporting
Objective: Compile findings, methodologies, and recommendations into a comprehensive report.
Actions:
Prepare detailed documentation of the analysis process, findings, and recommendations for stakeholders.
Include visualizations to illustrate key insights and support conclusions.
